Support for mapping relations between objects is intentionally missing.

Goals:

- one to one mapping between objects and database rows
- correctness
- ease of use
- small, simple implementation

Restrictions by design:

- maps class to table, table row to object instances
- relations between objects at the Python level are *NOT* supported
    + at the database level constraints including foreign keys are supported
- the name of the primary key is *id*.

Query language is SQL based.
